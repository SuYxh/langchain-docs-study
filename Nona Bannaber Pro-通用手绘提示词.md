I am uploading a technical documentation file. Please read and deeply understand its content, then create a hand-drawn style whiteboard illustration that visualizes the core concepts.

## Your Task

1. **Analyze the Document**:
   - Identify the main topic/concept being explained
   - Extract the key components and their relationships
   - Find any workflows, processes, or execution patterns
   - Note any problem-solution comparisons

2. **Create the Illustration** including:

   **A. Central Visual Metaphor**
   - Use **Doraemon (哆啦A梦)** as the main character representing the AI system
   - Show Doraemon with his iconic blue body, white face, and red ball nose
   - Doraemon should be holding a **tool pouch** (四次元口袋) representing tools/abilities
   - Include a thought bubble (💭) showing Doraemon thinking about the task

   **B. Core Components Diagram**
   - Position components around Doraemon in a clean, circular layout
   - Use simple icons with both English and Chinese labels:
     • Brain icon: "Model (推理引擎)" - placed above Doraemon
     • Tool pouch icons: "Tools (工具箱)" - placed to the left
     • Notebook icon: "Memory (记忆)" - placed to the right
     • Name tag: "System Prompt (人设)" - on Doraemon's chest

   **C. Process/Workflow Visualization**
   - Create a **clean circular flow** showing the main process:
     → THINK (思考) 💭 → ACT (行动) 🔧 → OBSERVE (观察) 👀 → OUTPUT (输出) ✅
   - Use distinct colors for each step: blue (think), orange (act), green (observe/output)
   - Draw arrows connecting each step in a clockwise direction

   **D. Pain Point vs Solution Panel**
   - Create two side-by-side panels at the bottom:
     • Left panel: "BEFORE (之前)" - Show a frustrated character surrounded by messy code/arrows
     • Right panel: "AFTER (之后)" - Show a happy character relaxing while Doraemon handles the task
   - Add speech bubbles with simple text like "太复杂了！" vs "交给我吧！"

   **E. Mini Example Scenario**
   - Include a small 3-4 panel comic strip in the corner
   - Show Doraemon helping a user with a simple task from the document
   - Use speech bubbles with short, clear text

## Style Requirements

- **Aesthetic**: Clean hand-sketched whiteboard style with clear lines
- **Layout**: Organized, uncluttered, with good whitespace between sections
- **Colors**: 
  • Main: Black line art with light blue background (like a clean whiteboard)
  • Accents: Blue (thinking), Orange (actions), Green (results)
  • Doraemon: Classic blue body with red nose and collar
- **Typography**: Handwritten-style labels, mix of English and Chinese
- **Icons**: Simple, recognizable symbols - no complex details
- **Composition**: Balanced layout with Doraemon in the center, components radiating outward
- **Tone**: Friendly, educational, and approachable - suitable for learning materials

## Output

Generate a **single cohesive illustration** that:
- Is visually clean and well-organized
- Uses Doraemon as the central character
- Clearly explains the core concept at a glance
- Serves as an effective learning aid
- Avoids clutter and maintains visual hierarchy
